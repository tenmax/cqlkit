# CQLKIT
*cqlkit* is a CLI tool to export Cassandra query to CSV and JSON format. Cassandra is not good at Ad-hoc query, *cqlkit* allows you to export query result to semi-structured(JSON) or structured data(CSV). There are many [tools](#recommended-3rd-party-tools) out there for you to query or process these kinds of format.

Here is a simple some examples.

Export JSON for the system columns in cassandra cluster.
 
```bash
cql2json -q "select peer, data_center, host_id, preferred_ip, rack, release_version from system.peers"
```

Export CSV for the system columns in cassandra cluster.

```bash
cql2csv -q "select peer, data_center, host_id, preferred_ip, rack, release_version from system.peers"
```

# Setup the cqlshrc
To connect to cassandra cluster, although we can use `-c` and `-k` to specify the contact server and keyspace respectively, to preapre a [cqlshrc](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/cqlsh.html#refCqlsh__cqlshUsingCqlshrc) is recommended to simply your query. *cqlshrc* is used by cqlsh. *cqlkit* leverages this file to connect to your cluster. Here is the setup steps.

1. Create the cqlshrc file at `~/.cassandra/cqlshrc`
2. Here is the example format.

   ```bash
   [authentication]
   keyspace = system

   [connection]
   hostname = 192.168.59.103
   port = 9042

   ; vim: set ft=dosini :
   ```
